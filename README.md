# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
# run test on local testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/buy-coffee.js

# deploy on goerli
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

```
